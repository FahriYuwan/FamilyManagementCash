# PWA Login Configuration

## Background
This document describes the changes made to configure the login page as the default entry point for the PWA (Progressive Web App) and to improve the user experience for mobile users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Login Page Modifications (`app/auth/login/page.tsx`)
- Removed demo account information section that was visible during development
- Added a clearer link to the registration page for new users
- Maintained all existing functionality (login form, password visibility toggle, remember me, forgot password)

### 2. PWA Manifest Configuration (`public/manifest.json`)
- Changed `start_url` from `/` to `/auth/login`
- This ensures that when users install the PWA on their mobile device, it will open directly to the login page
- Maintained all other PWA configuration settings

### 3. Service Worker Updates (`public/sw.js`)
- Added `/auth/login` and `/auth/register` to the cache list
- Ensures these critical authentication pages are available offline
- Maintained existing caching strategy for other resources

## Expected Results
1. When users install the PWA on their mobile device, it will open directly to the login page
2. Demo account information is no longer visible to end users
3. Clear navigation path to registration page for new users
4. Improved offline experience for authentication pages

## Testing
These changes have been tested to ensure:
- PWA installs correctly on mobile devices
- Application opens to login page after installation
- Login functionality works as expected
- Registration page is accessible from login page
- Offline access to authentication pages works

## Notes
- The demo accounts still exist in the database for development/testing purposes
- Only the UI display of demo account information has been removed
- All existing functionality remains intact
