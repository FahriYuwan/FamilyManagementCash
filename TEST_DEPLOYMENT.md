## üõ†Ô∏è Testing Procedures

### Manual Testing
1. Deploy application to test environment
2. Run through each test case above
3. Document any issues found
4. Verify fixes resolve all issues

### Automated Testing
1. Run unit tests for all services
2. Execute integration tests for core functionality
