# Database Schema Improvements Summary

This document summarizes all the improvements made to the database schema to address the notes and potential issues identified.

## 1. Fixed auth.uid() Issue in Trigger Functions

### Problem
In PostgreSQL triggers, `auth.uid()` might not always be available (especially when triggers run in the background without a user session), which could cause NULL values.

### Solution
Updated the `log_edit()` function to include a fallback mechanism:
```sql
-- Get current user ID with fallback
current_user_id := COALESCE(auth.uid(), NEW.user_id, OLD.user_id);
```

This ensures that even if `auth.uid()` is NULL, the trigger can still log the edit with the user_id from the record being modified.

## 2. Enhanced Edit History Table

### Problem
The edit_history table only stored user_id, table_name, and record_id. When records were deleted, there was no way to filter history by family, and the table reference was only available through the table_name field.

### Solution
1. Added a `family_id` column to the edit_history table:
```sql
family_id UUID REFERENCES public.families(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```

2. Updated the `log_edit()` function to automatically populate the family_id based on the table being modified:
```sql
-- Get family ID from the record being modified
IF TG_TABLE_NAME = 'users' THEN
  SELECT family_id INTO current_family_id FROM public.users WHERE id = COALESCE(NEW.id, OLD.id);
-- ... similar logic for other tables
```

3. Added an index for better performance:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_edit_history_family_id ON public.edit_history(family_id);
```

## 3. Fixed Orders & Expenses RLS Policies

### Problem
The RLS policies for orders and order_expenses only allowed users with the 'ayah' role to view data, even for family members. This meant that 'ibu' users couldn't see order data even though they're part of the same family.

### Solution
Updated the SELECT policies to allow family members to view orders and expenses regardless of their role:

For orders:
```sql
-- Family members can view orders regardless of role
CREATE POLICY "Family members can view orders" 
ON public.orders FOR SELECT 
USING (
  family_id IN (SELECT family_id FROM public.users WHERE id = auth.uid() AND family_id IS NOT NULL)
);
```

For order expenses:
```sql
-- Family members can view order expenses regardless of role
CREATE POLICY "Family members can view order expenses" 
ON public.order_expenses FOR SELECT 
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.orders o 
    WHERE o.id = order_id AND o.family_id IN (SELECT family_id FROM public.users WHERE id = auth.uid() AND family_id IS NOT NULL)
  )
);
```

## 4. Improved User Role Assignment Logic

### Problem
The `handle_new_user()` function was using email pattern matching (`email LIKE '%ayah%'`) to assign the 'ayah' role, which could cause false positives.

### Solution
Removed the email pattern matching and now rely solely on `raw_user_meta_data->>'role'`:
```sql
CASE 
  WHEN NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'role' = 'ayah' THEN 'ayah'::user_role
  ELSE 'ibu'::user_role
END
```

This change was also applied to the user sync query.

## 5. Added Composite Indexes for Better Performance

### Problem
While individual indexes existed, there was no optimization for common query patterns like filtering by family_id and date.

### Solution
Added composite indexes for common query patterns:
```sql
-- For household transactions
CREATE INDEX idx_household_transactions_family_date ON public.household_transactions(family_id, date);

-- For orders
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_family_date ON public.orders(family_id, order_date);
```

## 6. Enabled RLS on Families Table

### Problem
The families table had RLS disabled, which could be a security concern.

### Solution
Enabled RLS on the families table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.families ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## 7. Enhanced set_family_id Function

### Problem
The `set_family_id()` function didn't provide feedback when it couldn't set the family_id, which could lead to inconsistent data.

### Solution
Added logging to warn when family_id cannot be set:
```sql
-- Ensure family_id is always set for consistency
IF NEW.user_id IS NOT NULL AND NEW.family_id IS NULL THEN
  RAISE WARNING 'Could not set family_id for record in %.user_id: %', TG_TABLE_NAME, NEW.user_id;
END IF;
```

## Summary of Changes

All improvements have been made directly in the main schema file `supabase/family_management_schema.sql`. The changes include:

1. Enhanced trigger functions with better error handling and fallbacks
2. Extended edit_history table with family_id column and improved indexing
3. More permissive but still secure RLS policies for family data sharing
4. Safer user role assignment logic
5. Performance optimizations with composite indexes
6. Security improvements with RLS enabled on all tables
7. Better data consistency with enhanced trigger functions

These changes improve both the functionality and security of the application while maintaining the core requirement that family members can share relevant financial data.
