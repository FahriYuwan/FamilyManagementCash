# Session Persistence Fixes

## Background
Users were experiencing issues with session persistence on mobile devices where refreshing the page would cause them to be redirected to the login page. This was particularly problematic as it disrupted the user experience and made the application feel unreliable.

## Issues Identified
1. **Supabase Configuration**: The original configuration had conditional session persistence based on browser detection, which could fail in some mobile environments.
2. **Session Refresh**: There was no proactive session refresh mechanism to keep tokens valid.
3. **Auth State Handling**: The authentication state wasn't being properly maintained during page refreshes.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Supabase Client Configuration (`lib/supabase.ts`)
- Enabled persistent session storage unconditionally: `persistSession: true`
- Enabled automatic token refresh: `autoRefreshToken: true`
- Enabled URL session detection: `detectSessionInUrl: true`
- Set storage to always use `window.localStorage`
- Added PKCE flow type for better security: `flowType: 'pkce'`
- Changed cache control to `no-store` to prevent caching issues

### 2. Authentication Service Improvements (`lib/auth.tsx`)
- Enhanced session initialization with retry mechanism
- Added more comprehensive auth state change handling
- Improved `refreshUser` function with better error handling and retry logic
- Added `refreshSession` function to proactively refresh Supabase sessions
- Implemented periodic session refresh every 15 minutes
- Added better logging for debugging auth issues

### 3. Page-Level Session Management
Added periodic session refresh to key pages:
- Household Transactions Page
- Family Dashboard Page
- Business Orders Page
- Debts Page
- Settings Page

Each page now refreshes the session every 10 minutes to ensure tokens remain valid.

## How It Works
1. **On Page Load**: The app checks for an existing session and restores it
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Auth state changes are monitored and handled appropriately
3. **Proactive Refresh**: Sessions are refreshed periodically to prevent expiration
4. **Error Recovery**: Retry mechanisms handle temporary network issues

## Testing
These changes have been tested to ensure:
- Sessions persist after page refresh on both desktop and mobile
- Users are not redirected to login unnecessarily
- Real-time features continue to work after session refresh
- Family collaboration features remain functional

## Expected Results
- Users should no longer be redirected to login after refreshing on mobile devices
- Session persistence should work like Facebook - with extended login periods
- Improved reliability of real-time features
- Better user experience overall
