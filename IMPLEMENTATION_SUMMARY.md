## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Family Groups
- Users can create family groups
- Users can join existing family groups
- Users can leave family groups
- Each user belongs to at most one family

- Family members can view each other's business orders (for "Ayah" users)
- Family members can view each other's debts and receivables

### 3. Real-time Synchronization
- Automatic data updates when family members make changes
- No manual refresh required
- Proper subscription cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### 4. Access Controls

- Confirmed all required components are implemented

### Schema Verification (`test/schema-verification.sql`)
- Created SQL queries to verify database schema changes
- Confirmed table structures and relationships

## Deployment Considerations

### Database Migration
1. Apply the updated `supabase/schema.sql` to your Supabase instance
2. Existing data will be preserved
3. New columns will be added with appropriate foreign key constraints

### Application Deployment
1. Deploy the updated Next.js application
