# Family Synchronization Feature

## Overview
The Family Synchronization feature allows family members to share and view each other's financial data in real-time. This feature enables both parents to collaborate on household financial management while maintaining appropriate access controls.

## Key Features

### 1. Family Groups
- Families can create groups to connect multiple user accounts
- Each user can belong to only one family group
- Family groups contain all members' financial data

### 2. Real-time Data Synchronization
- All financial data is automatically synchronized across family members
- Changes made by one family member are instantly visible to others
- No manual refresh required

### 3. Shared Data Views
- **Household Transactions**: All family members can view each other's income and expenses
- **Business Orders**: "Ayah" users can view all business-related orders and expenses
- **Debts & Receivables**: All family members can track debts and receivables

### 4. Access Controls
- Users can only edit their own transactions, orders, and debts
- Family members can view all data but cannot modify others' entries
- Role-based access is maintained (only "Ayah" can manage business data)
