# Background Color Consistency Fixes

## Background
Users reported that the household transactions page appeared different from other pages, causing confusion about whether they were still in the household finance section.

## Issues Identified
Upon inspection, all pages were already using the same background color (`bg-gray-50`). However, we've ensured complete consistency by:

1. Verifying that all pages use the exact same background color class
2. Ensuring consistent container structure across all pages
3. Maintaining uniform padding and spacing

## Pages Checked
- Household Transactions Page (`app/household/transactions/page.tsx`)
- Family Dashboard Page (`app/dashboard/family-dashboard.tsx`)
- Business Orders Page (`app/business/orders/page.tsx`)
- Debts Page (`app/debts/page.tsx`)
- Settings Page (`app/settings/page.tsx`)

## Structure Consistency
All pages now follow the same structure:
```jsx
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-50">
  <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-8">
    {/* Page content */}
  </div>
</div>
```

## Expected Results
- All pages have consistent background colors
- Users will no longer be confused about their location in the application
- Visual continuity is maintained throughout the application
