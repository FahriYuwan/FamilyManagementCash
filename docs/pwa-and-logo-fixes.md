# PWA Navigation and Logo Consistency Fixes

## Overview

This document explains the changes made to fix two issues:
1. Logo color consistency across all application pages
2. PWA navigation issue where the app wasn't properly navigating to the login page after installation

## Logo Consistency Fixes

### Issue
The logo colors were inconsistent across different pages of the application, with some pages using different color schemes for icons.

### Solution
All pages now use consistent styling for their logos:
- All icons use the `text-primary-600` color class
- All icons are sized at `h-8 w-8`
- All icons have consistent spacing with `mr-3` margin to the right
- All page titles use the same font styling

### Pages Updated
1. **Household Transactions Page** (`/app/household/transactions/page.tsx`)
   - Uses Home icon with `text-primary-600` color
2. **Business Orders Page** (`/app/business/orders/page.tsx`)
   - Uses Package icon with `text-primary-600` color
3. **Debts Page** (`/app/debts/page.tsx`)
   - Uses CreditCard icon with `text-primary-600` color
4. **Settings Page** (`/app/settings/page.tsx`)
   - Uses Settings icon with `text-primary-600` color
5. **Reports Page** (`/app/reports/page.tsx`)
   - Uses BarChart3 icon with `text-primary-600` color

## PWA Navigation Fixes

### Issue
After installing the PWA, the application was not navigating correctly to the login page. Users would experience navigation issues when opening the installed app.

### Solution
Made improvements to both the service worker and manifest configuration:

1. **Service Worker Enhancements** (`/public/sw.js`):
   - Added explicit handling for navigation requests
   - Added fallback mechanism to serve login page from cache when offline
   - Expanded cached URLs to include more authentication pages
   - Added better error handling for API requests

2. **Manifest Configuration** (`/public/manifest.json`):
   - Added `scope` property set to "/"
   - Ensured `start_url` is properly set to "/auth/login"
   - Verified all icon assets are properly referenced

### Technical Details

#### Service Worker Changes
```javascript
// Handle navigation requests (for PWA navigation)
if (event.request.mode === 'navigate') {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match('/auth/login')
      .then((response) => {
        return response || fetch(event.request).catch(() => {
          // If fetch fails, serve the login page from cache as fallback
          return caches.match('/auth/login')
        })
      })
  )
  return
}
```

#### Manifest Changes
```json
{
  "start_url": "/auth/login",
  "scope": "/",
  // ... other properties
}
```

## Testing

To verify these fixes:

1. **Logo Consistency**:
   - Navigate to each page and verify that all logos use the same blue color (`text-primary-600`)
   - Check that all logos have consistent sizing and spacing

2. **PWA Navigation**:
   - Install the application as a PWA on a mobile device
   - Close and reopen the installed app
   - Verify that it correctly navigates to the login page
   - Test offline functionality to ensure the login page loads from cache

## Files Modified

1. `/public/sw.js` - Service worker enhancements
2. `/public/manifest.json` - Manifest configuration updates
3. `/app/reports/page.tsx` - Added consistent header with logo
4. `/app/settings/page.tsx` - Verified consistent header styling

Note: Other pages already had consistent logo styling and did not require changes.
