- [ ] Test family creation/joining functionality
- [ ] Verify real-time subscription functionality

### ‚úÖ Environment Variables Required
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### ‚úÖ Vercel Deployment Steps
1. Push all changes to your repository
2. Connect Vercel to your repository
3. Set environment variables in Vercel Dashboard
4. Deploy the application
5. Test all functionality in production environment

### ‚úÖ Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Test user registration and login
- [ ] Verify family creation and joining
- [ ] Test real-time updates between family members
- [ ] Check edit history functionality
- [ ] Validate all CRUD operations
- [ ] Test export functionality (PDF/Excel)

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### üî¥ Supabase Client Initialization Failed
**Symptoms**: Blank pages, authentication errors
**Solutions**:
1. Verify environment variables are set correctly
2. Check Supabase project URL and anon key
3. Ensure Supabase project is not paused/suspended

### üî¥ RLS Policy Errors
**Symptoms**: 403 Forbidden errors, permission denied
**Solutions**:
1. Verify database schema is up to date
2. Check RLS policies in Supabase dashboard
3. Ensure user has proper role assignments
4. Check for conflicting policies on the same table (particularly families table)
5. Ensure only one INSERT policy exists for the families table if family creation fails with 403 error
6. Re-run the main schema file: `supabase/family_management_schema.sql`
7. As a temporary workaround, disable RLS with: `ALTER TABLE public.families DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`

### üî¥ Real-time Updates Not Working
**Symptoms**: Family member counts not updating, delayed updates
**Solutions**:
1. Verify real-time subscriptions are properly set up
2. Check network connectivity to Supabase
3. Ensure family members are properly linked in database
4. **Verify that both users have joined the same family**
5. **Check that the family_id is properly set for both users**
6. **Ensure real-time subscriptions are properly cleaned up and re-established**

### üî¥ Family Members Cannot See Each Other
**Symptoms**: Users in the same family cannot see each other in the member list
**Solutions**:
1. **Verify both users have joined the same family using the same family ID**
2. **Check that the family_id is properly set for both users in the database**
3. **Re-run the main schema file: `supabase/family_management_schema.sql`**
4. **Ensure real-time subscriptions are working correctly**
5. **Verify that RLS policies allow family members to view each other's data**
6. **Check that the getUserProfile function is properly fetching family data with all members**

### üî¥ Edit History Not Displaying
**Symptoms**: Empty edit history, loading indicators stuck
**Solutions**:
1. Verify edit_history table exists and has proper RLS policies
2. Check database triggers for edit logging
3. Validate family_id relationships in database
